1️⃣ Term Project 1 — Unix Shell Implementation (C Language)
A custom Unix-like command line shell developed in C that can parse and execute user commands similar to a Linux terminal. The shell supports features such as command execution, piping, signal handling, and command history management, demonstrating core concepts of process management, system calls, and OS-level programming.

2️⃣ Term Project 2 — VSFS File System Checker
A Virtual Simple File System (VSFS) consistency checker written in C that analyzes a disk image to verify the correctness of file system structures. It inspects metadata such as superblocks, inode tables, and bitmaps to detect inconsistencies, corruption, or allocation errors, illustrating key concepts of file system design and storage integrity.
